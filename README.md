# <p align="center"> SEU Researchers (Native Android App) </p>
### (App will be in service at Southeast University from NOVEMBER 2022 [Fall semester])

## Project Introduction

A final-year undergrad must com-
plete academic research to be gradu-
ated. From the very beginning of re-
search registration, students face some
problems. Most of the students are
confused about choosing a topic and
finding a supervisor. Primarily a stu-
dent has no idea about which facul-
ties are available or what their research
interests are and who will be a good
match. Different faculties have dif-
ferent areas of research interest. To
know their research interest or their
availability or any kind of information,
students have to ask them individu-
ally which is time-consuming as facul-
ties can’t reply immediately to all the
students. At this moment southeast
university doesn’t have any kind of
research-related information manage-
ment system. Thus the existing man-
ual process is a bit difficult for both the
teachers and students. Our android-
based application SEU Researchers
will be a perfect solution to this prob-
lem. The main purpose of our pro-
posed system is to provide research-
related facilities to students and teach-
ers. A student will be able to eas-
ily group up with other students on-
line, see which supervisors are avail-
able, what are their research inter-
ests and research requirements, and
send research proposals to the facul-
ties. They can find out whether they
meet their supervisor’s requirements or
not. Faculties will be able to track
research groups, can see the propos-
als, and accept or reject them. Our
android application has all solutions
to every problem that students and
teachers are facing today.

## Project goals

1. A student will be able to easily group up with other students online.
2. Students will be able to
    - see which supervisors are available,
    - see faculties research requirements and their area of interest,
    - find whether they meet their supervisor?s requirements or not.
3. Teachers will be able to track research groups under their supervision.
4. Create a virtual communication system between teachers and students by
allow students sending research proposal and get is accepted or rejected by
the supervisors.
5. Overall a dynamic research management system.



## Use Cases
    1.  A student logs into the “SEU Researcher” Application.
    2.  Student will sign up using his or her id and set a password.
    3.  Student enters his or her email/id and password to login.

    5.  Student fills the “Research Team” section.
